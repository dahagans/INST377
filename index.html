			<b>Description:</b>


			
			<p>
			
					Pilots fly  and navigate airplanes, helicopters,
					and other types of aircraft. Airline pilots work for specific 
					companies, transporting people and cargo on fixed schedules, while
					commercial pilots work for companies that offer charter flights, rescue operations,
					or aerial photography.	
			</p>
			<br>
			<b>  Responsibilities:</b>	
			  <br>
			<p>


					Airline pilot duties are very limited when working with large airlines, and they will have almost
					 no other responsibilities. They will check the weather, then plot a flight plan. During flight, they
					  constantly watch instruments, make adjustments, report to air-route control stations enroute, and talk to 
					  the tower at their destination. When working in a smaller plane, however, the job may be much more physical. 
					  This could include loading passenger luggage, supervising fueling, performing aircraft maintenance, and more. 
					  All pilots are responsible to fill out records and reports, Pilots and co-pilots often take turns flying different legs of a flight.
