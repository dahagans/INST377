        <b> Responsibilities:</b>
        Pilots are responsible for the operation of the aircraft, the safety of the passengers and crew members, and all
        flight decisions once in the air. Their primary concern, however, is the safety of the plane and passengers.
        They must maintain a highly professional image in both conduct and personal appearance, and communicate with the
        passengers and crew during flights. The pilot makes all final decisions about anything occurring during the
        flight. Some pilots may also be approved by the Federal Flight Deck Officer program and may carry firearms to
        protect the cockpit

        Pilots fly and navigate airplanes, helicopters,
        and other types of aircraft. Airline pilots work for specific
        companies, transporting people and cargo on fixed schedules, while
        commercial pilots work for companies that offer charter flights, rescue operations,
        or aerial photography.
